# Solaris — Requirements (as-built tier)

**What the code contractually does today.** `DR-<AREA>-<n>`, descriptive present, `file:line`
anchors, each citing the `R-` tag it implements ([`../REQUIREMENTS.md`](../REQUIREMENTS.md)). An
entry with a dead anchor is a defect, and a behaviour with no entry does not ship.

## Conformance

Rung **0** of `arstro.rule` §5 — specified, no code yet. The ladder and where each rung lands:

| rung | means | lands with |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | spec only | ← **here** (S0) |
| 1 | core split out; `Command`/`Event`/model with one text codec | V1 |
| 2 | registered with the root `ctest`; L2 headless service tests | V1 |
| 3 | a real CLI that is the whole app without a window | V2 |
| 4 | generated API document, committed, drift-tested | V3 |
| 5 | control socket + the GUI/headless equivalence test | X4 |

## Entries

Anchors without a path prefix are under `apps/solaris/`. Anchors into the DSP library are relative to `core/DigitalSignalProcessing/` — that is where
Solaris's sound lives (R-DSP-1).

### DR-DSP-1 Every instrument and effect is a registry entry in the DSP library (R-DSP-1, R-DSP-2, R-DSP-3)
`DeviceRegistry::types()` (`src/device/DeviceRegistry.cpp:376`) holds nine `DeviceType`s
(`src/device/Device.h:46`) in a stable order — `synth`, `drums`, `compressor`, `eq`, `reverb`,
`delay`, `chorus`, `drive`, `filter` — each with its `ParamSpec`s (`src/device/Device.h:27`): name,
label, unit, range, default, choices. A `Device` (`src/device/Device.h:59`) is the one face a host
drives: `process` (effect in place, instrument adds), notes, `reset`, `setParam` by index or by name
in engineering units. `ParamSpec::clamp` (`src/device/DeviceRegistry.cpp:19`) is the write rule:
into range, rounded for integers and choices, non-finite → default; an unknown name changes nothing
and returns false. The instruments' defaults are read from the instruments, so registry and
instrument cannot disagree. **Solaris does not consume it yet** — that lands with E1/V1. Guarded in
the DSP repo by `unittest/deviceTests.cpp` (a sweep of every parameter of every type at both ends
renders finite) and `registry_eq_by_name` (a parameter written by name matches the RBJ formula to
0.000 dB).

### DR-INST-1 The Basic Synth (R-INST-1)
`BasicSynth` (`src/instrument/BasicSynth.cpp:171` renders): per voice two `Oscillator`s (waveform,
octave, semitone, cents, level, unison + detune) and `Noise` → a `StateVariableFilter` swept per
sample by its own ADSR and key tracking in octaves (`cutoffFor`, `:92`) → an amplitude ADSR. 16
voices; the same note retriggers, else an idle voice, else the oldest is stolen (`noteOn`, `:99`).
The oscillators' own ADSRs are gates, so the release tail is never cut. Registry type `synth`,
parameters `osc1.*`, `osc2.*`, `noise`, `filter.*`, `fenv.*`, `amp.*`, `volume`, `velocity`.
Guarded by the DSP repo's `instrumentTests.cpp` and `synth2_equal_temperament` (0.026 cents).

### DR-INST-2 The Drum Machine (R-INST-2)
`DrumMachine` (`src/instrument/DrumMachine.cpp:210`, one model per pad): kick 36, rim 37, snare 38,
clap 39, low tom 41, closed hat 42, mid tom 45, open hat 46, high tom 48, cowbell 56, each
synthesized from `Phasor`, seeded `Noise`, `StateVariableFilter` and `DecayEnvelope` — no samples.
Per pad `tune`, `decay`, `tone`, `level`, `pan` (registry `kick.tune` … `cowbell.pan`, plus
`volume`); the closed hat chokes the open hat (`:185`); `reset()` reseeds, so a pattern replays
byte-identically. Guarded by `instrumentTests.cpp` and `kick_settles_on_its_tuned_fundamental`.

### DR-FX-1 The basic effects (R-FX-1…4)
Registry types `compressor`, `eq`, `reverb`, `delay`, `chorus`, `drive`, `filter`. `eq` is
`ParametricEQ` (`src/equalizer/ParametricEQ.cpp:5`): seven `Biquad` bands built by the RBJ cookbook
(`src/equalizer/Biquad.cpp:46`) — low cut, low shelf, three peaks, high shelf, high cut — transparent
when fresh. `filter` is the synth's SVF with a mix (`src/device/DeviceRegistry.cpp:328`). The rest
wrap `Compressor`, `Reverb`, `Repeater`, `Chorus` and `Overdrive` unchanged
(`EffectDevice`, `src/device/DeviceRegistry.cpp:221`). R-FX-5 (a strip's rack) is Solaris's and is
not built yet.

### DR-FMT-1 The `.slp` document (R-FMT-1, R-FMT-2, R-FMT-4)
`solaris_model` (`model/Project.h`) holds the document as typed data — header, `#aport`,
`#amixer`, `#atrack` (strip), `#asend`, `#arack`/`#aeffect`, `#alane`, `#apattern`/`#note`,
`#aclip` — and links nothing but the standard library: a device is its registry `type` plus its
parameters as text, which the core checks against the DSP registry. `parseProject`
(`model/Project.cpp:292`) reads the suite grammar: header `key = value`, node lines, indented
continuation lines, whole-line and inline `;` comments (kept with the node they follow), unknown
keys (kept in order) and unknown nodes (kept verbatim with their indented lines). The suite's
inline `#note`s under an `#aclip` become a pattern of their own — the one normalisation, reported.
`serializeProject` (`model/Project.cpp:516`) writes §10's canonical form: `canonicalNumber`
(`model/Format.cpp:33`, shortest round-trip, always a point), `canonicalBeats` (`:52`, rounded to
1/960 beat, fewest decimals that read back to the tick), seconds to the microsecond; defaults of
optional fields are omitted. **Parse → serialize is a byte-exact fixed point** for canonical text.
Refused, each naming what and where (`validateProject`, `model/Project.cpp:623`): duplicate ids,
`master` as an id, unknown strip kinds, dangling references, an audio clip on a non-audio strip, a
note clip on a non-instrument strip, `in ≥ out`, a clip before the song, two racks for one strip,
an input port as a destination, a header that is not `app = solaris` / `timebase = beats` /
`ppq = 960`. Repaired and counted (`Reader::num`, `:165`): a non-finite or unreadable number → the
field's default; out-of-range pan, pitch and velocity clamp. Guarded by `solaris_model` (8 tests;
mutants checked: dropping unknown keys on write breaks the fixed point).

### DR-MIX-4 Routing only goes forward (R-MIX-4)
`validateProject`'s `checkTarget` (`model/Project.cpp:640`) accepts an `out` or a send target only
when it is `master`, an output port, or a strip whose mixer's `order` is GREATER than the source
strip's; anything else is refused as `ch_1 (Main, on Buses) output → ch_2 (kick, on Sources): a
strip can only feed a strip on a LATER mixer, the master or a port (R-MIX-4)`. A file that routes
backward does not load. Because of this, `Project::stripsInOrder` (`model/Project.cpp:97`) —
mixer order, then strip order — is a topological order of the routing graph with no cycle check
at all. A new project is `newProject` (`model/Project.cpp:134`): Sources (`mx_1`), Buses (`mx_2`)
holding the bus Main (`ch_1` → master), the port Main (`prt_1`) fed by the master (R-MIX-3).
Guarded by `test_routing_only_goes_forward` (mutant checked: `<=` → `<` lets a same-mixer route
through and the test fails).

### DR-ENG-1 The engine renders a MixGraph through the DSP library's devices (R-MIX-1/5/6, R-DSP-1/5, R-RENDER-1)
`solaris_engine` knows no project and no file: it renders a `MixGraph` (`engine/MixGraph.h`) —
strips in processing order with their devices (registry types + values), audio regions in samples
over decoded PCM, note events in samples, an output and sends as forward indices, the master's rack
and gain, the ports. `Engine::build` (`engine/Engine.cpp:72`) refuses a target that is not LATER
(R-MIX-4, a second time — the graph might not come from the model), a missing port, an unknown
device type or parameter, an instrument strip whose rack does not start with an instrument; sets
the DSP library's process-wide sample rate (R-NFR-7); builds every device with
`DeviceRegistry::create`; and **warms** each with one block of silence (`warm`, `:47`), because the
library smooths every parameter write over a block and the first block of every render would
otherwise carry a ramp from the device's default. `renderPiece` (`:206`) per strip in order: sum
what earlier strips routed/sent to it; add its regions (looped, offset, offline = silent) or play
its instrument with the block **split at every note event** (`:249`, R-DSP-5); run the rest of its
rack (bypass skips); tap pre-fader sends; fader + balance pan; post-fader sends; add into its
output (`route`, `:179` — master, a later strip, or a port; a mono port gets the average of L and
R). A silent strip (muted or solo-silenced, decided by the core) sends nothing anywhere (`:276`).
Then the master rack, master gain, its ports. Meters (peak, RMS per render call, max peak since
`clearPeaks`), a captured strip for stems, live parameter writes, `seek` (instruments reset, effect
tails ring on). Guarded by `solaris_engine` (8 tests): a region sounds from its first sample to its
last; mute/pre/post/port routing; refusals; **a note moved one sample later renders exactly one
sample later, to the bit** (mutant checked: applying events at block starts fails it); **two engines
rendering in chunks of 128 and of 77 are byte-identical** over a second of drums, synth, chorus,
compressor, reverb and EQ — which is how DSP `a16e972` (the synth's shared noise) was found.

### DR-MIX-11 The mix laws are Interstellar's (R-MIX-11)
`engine/MixLaws.h`: dB → linear `10^(dB/20)`; `balancePan` (`:24`) — unity at centre, the side
panned away from falls on a quarter cosine; `fadeGain` (`:32`) — linear in amplitude — the same
formulas as `apps/interstellar/render/AudioMix.cpp`. Guarded by `test_pan_and_fades_follow…`, which
checks a 0.5 region at pan +0.5, −6 dB to 1e-7 against the closed forms.

# cosmo — Defect List

**Committed, so it travels between machines and sessions.** Filed and closed by
`.claude/skills/arstro.cosmo.core.debug/` and `.claude/skills/arstro.cosmo.design.debug/`; the entry
format is defined in `arstro.cosmo.core.debug` §4 and is shared by both.

- IDs are `D-<n>`, sequential across both areas, **never reused**. Next free id: **D-13**.
- Status: `Open` · `Confirmed` · `Fixed` · `Not-a-defect` · `Unreproduced` · `Deferred`.
- Severity: `S1` data loss / crash / hang · `S2` wrong output or an unusable surface · `S3` wrong
  behaviour with a workaround · `S4` cosmetic or diagnostic.
- A resolved entry moves to `## Closed` with its commit hash and the test that now guards it. **Nothing
  is ever deleted.**

The entries below were found by reading the source on 2026-08-16, while writing the cosmo skills. They
are **confirmed in the code but not yet reproduced at runtime** — each says so. Most are observability
and reachability gaps, which is why `PROGRESS.md`'s NEXT is the P0 harness.

### D-10 — A failing assert in `cosmo_core_tests` hangs instead of exiting
- **Area:** core / test harness · **Status:** Confirmed (reproduced) · **Severity:** S3
- **Found:** 2026-08-16, while checking that the R-CPU-3 test fails without its fix
- **Reproduce:** break any assertion in `sessionTests.cpp` (e.g. stop `AppSettings::save()` writing
  `cpuPercent=`), rebuild, and run
  `XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/tmp/s ./build-mingw64/apps/cosmo/core/cosmo_core_tests.exe`.
- **Expected:** the assert prints to stderr and the process exits non-zero, so `ctest` reports a
  failure and an agent gets an answer in seconds.
- **Actual:** the process hangs indefinitely (killed at 5 min twice). MinGW/msvcrt `abort()` raises
  the Windows "terminated in an unusual way" path rather than exiting, and the assert text never
  reaches a redirected stderr because it is not flushed. A failing suite is indistinguishable from
  a slow one — and this suite legitimately takes 1–2 minutes (Release; longer in Debug), so the
  usual "it must be stuck" heuristic does not apply.
- **Evidence:** the same defect, isolated into a 10-line program linking `cosmo_core`, answered in
  under a second: `wrote cpuPercent=25, read back 50 -> FAIL`.
- **Judgement:** defect — no requirement covers the test harness, but "verify with a shell command"
  (the whole `R-AGENT` premise) is unusable when a red suite looks like a hung one.
- **Fix:** pending. Call `SetErrorMode(SEM_FAILCRITICALERRORS|SEM_NOGPFAULTERRORBOX)` +
  `_set_abort_behavior(0, _WRITE_ABORT_MSG|_CALL_REPORTFAULT)` on Windows in the suites' `main()`,
  and `setvbuf(stderr, nullptr, _IONBF, 0)`. Fold into P0.3 or P0.11.

### D-9 — Two divergent build paths, two undocumented build trees
- **Area:** core / build · **Status:** Confirmed (by source inspection) · **Severity:** S4
- **Found:** 2026-08-16, source inspection
- **Reproduce:** compare `./build.sh --project cosmo --target linux-native-app` (a hand-rolled one-shot
  `g++` producing `apps/cosmo/build/cosmo_linux`) with `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build`
  (producing `build/apps/cosmo/cosmo`). Also `ls build/apps/cosmo/cosmo.exe build-mingw64/apps/cosmo/cosmo.exe`.
- **Expected:** one documented way to build cosmo per platform.
- **Actual:** two Linux paths with different output names, different flags and no shared tests;
  `build.sh` cannot build cosmo on Windows at all (hardcoded `-lEGL -lGL`, `nproc`). Two Ninja trees
  exist on this host — `build/` (Debug, wired to `.vscode`) and `build-mingw64/` (Release) — with no
  documented distinction. `build.sh --target native-test` covers neither cosmo nor genesis.
- **Judgement:** requirement gap — nothing states which build path is canonical.
- **Fix:** pending. Resolve in P0.11 (`docs/DEVELOPING.md`) with an `R-AGENT-*` requirement naming the
  canonical path per platform.

### D-8 — `configDir()` resolves to the wrong place outside an MSYS2 shell
- **Area:** core / persistence · **Status:** Confirmed (by source inspection) · **Severity:** S3
- **Found:** 2026-08-16, source inspection
- **Reproduce:** launch `build\apps\cosmo\cosmo.exe` from cmd.exe or Explorer (where `HOME` is unset)
  and look for `.config\cosmo_v2\` **relative to the current directory**.
- **Expected:** settings, recents and the log land in one predictable per-user location on Windows.
- **Actual:** `ProjectStore::configDir()` reads `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, else `HOME` (never `USERPROFILE`),
  else `"."` — so a non-MSYS2 launch scatters config next to wherever it was started from. Supporting
  evidence: `C:\Users\Nam Doan\.config\cosmo_v2\` exists on this host but is **empty** — no log, no
  settings, no recents — so a real session's state has never been observed there.
- **Judgement:** requirement gap — no requirement states the Windows config location.
- **Fix:** pending (P0.12). Until then, always set `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` explicitly in scripted runs.

### D-7 — No headless UI render is possible; the CMake glob structurally prevents one
- **Area:** design / build · **Status:** Confirmed (by source inspection) · **Severity:** S3
- **Found:** 2026-08-16, source inspection
- **Reproduce:** `grep -n "file(GLOB COSMO_SOURCES" -A4 apps/cosmo/CMakeLists.txt` — the glob includes
  `linux_main.cpp`, so no second `main()` can link the cosmo UI.
- **Expected:** any screen or state renderable to a PNG with no display, as `genesis_shots` does.
- **Actual:** impossible today. `App` is already platform-free and drivable (`App(w,h)`, `setSize`,
  `render(target,nowMs)`, `pointer`, `wheel`, `key`, and public `showHome`/`showEditor`/
  `beginOpenTransition`/`setLoadProgress`/`finishOpenTransition`) — only the missing
  `list(REMOVE_ITEM … linux_main.cpp)` stands in the way. `cosmo_widget_tests` covers isolated widget
  hit-testing only, never the assembled app.
- **Judgement:** defect against the family design rule that a UI change must be *seen* before it ships
  (`arstro.design.desktop` §5) — currently unsatisfiable for cosmo.
- **Fix:** pending. P0.1 → P0.3.

### D-6 — A project cannot be opened from the command line
- **Area:** core / CLI · **Status:** Confirmed (by source inspection) · **Severity:** S3
- **Found:** 2026-08-16, source inspection
- **Reproduce:** `./build/apps/cosmo/cosmo.exe some.cmp` — `openPath()` special-cases only `.cosmo`, so
  a `.cmp`/`.cosmoproj` falls through to `openImageFile()` and fails to decode.
- **Expected:** the primary document format is openable from a shell.
- **Actual:** only bare images and `.cosmo` sessions are. Seeding `recent.tsv` is the sole way to make a
  project reachable, and that only puts it on the home screen.
- **Judgement:** requirement gap — no requirement covers command-line invocation at all.
- **Fix:** pending. P0.7 (`--project`).

### D-5 — The UI logs nothing, so a visual bug report cannot be traced
- **Area:** design / observability · **Status:** Confirmed (by source inspection) · **Severity:** S2
- **Found:** 2026-08-16, source inspection
- **Reproduce:** `grep -rn "LOG[DIWE]" apps/cosmo/App.cpp apps/cosmo/widgets/ | wc -l` → 0. The only
  `LOGI` calls in the whole desktop app are startup and the export batch start/finish.
- **Expected:** the user says "this button does nothing" and the log says which widget consumed the
  click, or that nothing did.
- **Actual:** clicks, screen transitions, selections, panel and tab changes, scroll clamping, value
  commits and renders are all invisible. This is the single biggest observability gap in the app and it
  blocks the intended workflow (user reports a symptom → agent reads the log).
- **Judgement:** defect — no requirement guarantees it, but the reporting workflow is unusable without
  it. `R-AGENT-*` will state the contract.
- **Fix:** pending. P0.4 + P0.5.

### D-4 — No stack trace on a Windows crash
- **Area:** core / observability · **Status:** Confirmed (by source inspection) · **Severity:** S3
- **Found:** 2026-08-16, source inspection
- **Reproduce:** inspect `apps/cosmo/Log.cpp` — the fatal-signal handler writes a banner for
  SIGSEGV/SIGABRT/SIGFPE/SIGILL (+SIGBUS on POSIX) but the `backtrace_symbols_fd` frame dump is POSIX-only
  and explicitly skipped on Windows.
- **Expected:** a crash on the development host produces frames.
- **Actual:** a signal name and nothing else — on the very host this project is developed on.
- **Judgement:** defect against R-NFR / DR-NFR-5's intent (a crash leaves a diagnosable record).
- **Fix:** pending. P0.4 (`CaptureStackBackTrace` + dbghelp).

### D-3 — GTK/GLib warnings never reach the log file
- **Area:** core / observability · **Status:** Confirmed (by source inspection) · **Severity:** S3
- **Found:** 2026-08-16, source inspection
- **Reproduce:** `linux_main.cpp` installs `g_set_print_handler` and `g_set_printerr_handler`, but
  `g_warning`/`g_critical`/`g_message` go through `g_log`, which neither handler sees.
- **Expected:** DR-NFR-5 says every `g_print`/`g_printerr` is routed through the log; the same intent
  covers GTK's own diagnostics, which are exactly what you need when rendering or a dialog misbehaves.
- **Actual:** they hit stderr only and vanish from the file. `G_DEBUG=fatal-warnings` under gdb is the
  only current way to catch them.
- **Judgement:** defect — DR-NFR-5's intent is not met for the diagnostics that matter most.
- **Fix:** pending. P0.4 (`g_log_set_default_handler`).

### D-2 — The log level is never checked; `LOGD` and `setStderrEcho()` are dead
- **Area:** core / observability · **Status:** Confirmed (by source inspection) · **Severity:** S3
- **Found:** 2026-08-16, source inspection
- **Reproduce:** read `log::write()` in `apps/cosmo/Log.cpp` — no level comparison anywhere; then
  `grep -rn "LOGD\|setStderrEcho" apps/cosmo/` — `LOGD` is never called and `setStderrEcho()` is never
  called.
- **Expected:** a debug mode that can be turned up for an investigation and down for normal use, per
  `DR-NFR-5`'s "timestamped levelled log".
- **Actual:** the levels are decorative. Every line is always written to both the file and stderr; there
  is no verbosity flag, no category filter, no way to silence the stderr echo, and no way to relocate the
  file except via `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`/`HOME`.
- **Judgement:** defect — "levelled" is stated in DR-NFR-5 and is not implemented.
- **Fix:** pending. P0.4.

### D-1 — Three design docs still describe the removed `onLoadingReady` hook
- **Area:** core / docs · **Status:** Confirmed (by source inspection) · **Severity:** S4
- **Found:** 2026-08-16, source inspection
- **Reproduce:** `grep -rn "onLoadingReady" apps/cosmo/docs/ apps/cosmo/REQUIREMENTS.md`
- **Expected:** `design.md`, `architecture.md` and `detailed_design.md` agree with `REQUIREMENTS.md` and
  `docs/requirements.md`.
- **Actual:** they still say the decode is deferred to an `onLoadingReady` hook firing at the intro
  boundary. `R-LOADPERF` amended that — the decode now starts *with* the transition — and
  `DR-LOADUX` records that the hook is gone.
- **Judgement:** defect — a doc-sync failure, which is exactly what the V-model's sync check exists to
  prevent. A future session reading `design.md` first would build against the old model.
- **Fix:** pending. Do it in the next task that touches loading (P1).

### D-11 — The CPU budget is enforced per-subsystem, so a load peaks at ~2× what the user chose
- **Area:** core / load · **Status:** **Fixed** (S1) · **Severity:** S2
- **Found:** 2026-08-17, same investigation as D-12
- **Reproduce:** (no shell reproduction exists — that is D-6, and is the point) read the three call
  sites and evaluate them for one budget:
  ```bash
  grep -n "workersFor" apps/cosmo/linux_main.cpp apps/cosmo/App.cpp
  #  linux_main.cpp:724  workersFor(cpuPercent, kMaxDecodeWorkers)   -> decode pool
  #  App.cpp:869         workersFor(cpuPercent)                      -> engine Auto threads
  nproc
  ```
- **Expected:** R-CPU-1: "cosmo's background CPU work runs on a **budget**: a percentage of the
  machine's logical cores". A user who picks 25% expects cosmo to schedule at most 25% of the cores.
- **Actual:** the percentage is converted independently by each consumer and the two run
  **concurrently** — by design, since R-LOADPERF-3 streams decoded images into a live editor, so the
  decode pool and the engine's preview renders overlap for most of a load. Peak scheduled threads is
  `decodeWorkers + engineThreads + 1 (UI)`, i.e. roughly **twice the budget plus one**:

  | cores | budget | decode pool | engine Auto | peak threads | share of machine |
  |------:|-------:|------------:|------------:|-------------:|-----------------:|
  | 24 | 25% | 6 | 6 | 13 | **54%** |
  | 24 | 50% | 8 (cap) | 12 | 21 | **88%** |
  | 16 | 50% | 8 (cap) | 8 | 17 | **106% — oversubscribed** |

  So the shipped default (50%) can still schedule the whole machine, which is the complaint the
  feature was written to answer.
- **Judgement:** defect — contradicts R-CPU-1 as written. Not a requirement gap: R-CPU-1 already says
  "a share of the machine, not all of it", and R-CPU-2 lists the three consumers without ever saying
  they divide one budget rather than each taking the whole of it.
- **Cause:** `AppSettings::workersFor()` is a pure function each consumer calls for itself
  (`AppSettings.cpp:14`). Nothing owns the total, and nothing can — the two consumers live in
  different layers (host and app) and neither can see the other.
- **Requirement:** R-CPU-1, R-CPU-2 (existing). If the sum is judged acceptable, R-CPU-1 must be
  amended to say the budget is *per pool* — but that would make the number meaningless to a user.
- **Fix:** commit `afe6704`. `cosmo::ThreadBudget` converts the percentage **once** into `total()`
  and divides it: the decode pool *reserves* `total - engineFloor` (capped at 8) for the load's
  duration and the engine gets the remainder, so it holds the whole budget when idle and shrinks only
  while a load runs. `AppSettings::workersFor` has no callers left in the app. R-CPU-2 and R-CPU-4
  amended; the load now logs the allotment and the **measured** peak.
- **Guarded by:** `one_budget_is_divided_not_duplicated` (fails on the old arithmetic at exactly the
  `decode + engine <= total` assertion — checked, not assumed) and
  `project_load_peak_never_exceeds_its_pool`. Measured end to end on 24 cores with the reported
  18-RAF project: 25% → pool 5, peak 5, **19% of the machine** mean over a 35 s load.

### D-12 — `OMP_NUM_THREADS` is set too late to bind, so R-CPU-2(c) does nothing
- **Area:** core / load · **Status:** **Fixed** (S1) · **Severity:** S2
- **Found:** 2026-08-17, debugging "CPU limit 25% still uses ~75% when opening a project"
- **Reproduce:**
  ```bash
  gcc -fopenmp -O1 -o /tmp/omp_env_order apps/cosmo/core/tests/fixtures/omp_env_order.c
  /tmp/omp_env_order                      # setenv() inside main(): team size = every core
  OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 /tmp/omp_env_order    # set before exec: team size = 1
  ```
- **Expected:** `linux_main.cpp:1282`'s `g_setenv("OMP_NUM_THREADS", "1", FALSE)` pins every nested
  OpenMP team to one thread, so "a decode worker means exactly one core" (R-CPU-2c).
- **Actual:** it has no effect. libgomp parses the environment in an **ELF constructor**, which runs
  when the library is loaded — before `main()` — so a `setenv`/`g_setenv` from `main()` is read by
  nobody. On this 24-core host:
  ```
  before setenv: omp_get_max_threads() = 24
  after  setenv: omp_get_max_threads() = 24
  actual parallel-region team size = 24  (machine has 24 cores)
  ```
  With the same variable set before `exec`, all three read 1. The commit that introduced the budget
  (5cb2688) calls this "the third layer, and the one that mattered" — on MSYS2, whose LibRaw *is*
  built `-fopenmp`, it is therefore still true that each decode worker opens a team sized to the
  whole machine, which is the reported 25%-budget-uses-75% symptom.
- **Judgement:** defect — contradicts R-CPU-2(c) ("nested parallelism inside a decoder … pin it to 1")
  and R-CPU-4's claim that the budget bounds "the one nested pool it can reach".
- **Cause:** environment variables consumed by a library constructor cannot be set from `main()`.
- **Platform note:** inert on this Linux host — the vendored `lib/LibRaw/lib/libraw.a` has zero
  `GOMP_*` symbols (`nm … | grep -c GOMP_` → 0), so there is no nested team here to pin. Live on
  MSYS2/Windows, where the CPU limit was developed and where the symptom was reported.
- **Requirement:** R-CPU-2, R-CPU-4 (both existing; neither needs amending — the code does not do
  what they say)
- **Fix:** commit `afe6704` — option (a). `cosmo_v2::pinNestedOpenMPForThisThread()`
  (`apps/cosmo/OmpPin.cpp`) resolves `omp_set_num_threads` via `dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, …)` /
  `GetProcAddress`, so nothing links OpenMP, and `ProjectLoader`'s new per-worker start hook calls it
  **on each decode worker** — the ICV is per-thread, so the main thread could never have done it.
  `ompPinStatus()` is logged at startup so the mechanism is checked rather than assumed.
  **Mechanism proven** by a second fixture (`omp_pin.c`, scratch): three pinned pthreads report team
  size 1 while an unpinned control on the same machine reports 24. **Not observable in cosmo on this
  Linux host** — the vendored libraw.a has no OpenMP, so the startup line correctly reads
  `no OpenMP runtime loaded`. Confirm on MSYS2, where the symptom was reported, by checking for
  `nested OpenMP teams pinned to 1 per decode worker` in the log.
- **Guarded by:** `project_load_peak_never_exceeds_its_pool` asserts the hook ran once per worker.
